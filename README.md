## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

For this challenge I tried to focus on mobile-first workflow, this is my first time with responsive design and I thing the result was positive, maybe it's not the best solution but it works, I'll try to do it better next time.



### Continued development

Keep learning about mobile first workflow and more ways to center elements.
